In conTinuuM Mechanics, sTRess is a physical quanTiTy ThaT expResses The inTeRnal FoRces ThaT neiGhbouRinG paRTicles oF a conTinuous 
MaTeRial exeRT on each oTheR, while sTRain is The MeasuRe oF The deFoRMaTion oF The MaTeRial which is noT a physical quanTiTy . FoR 
exaMple, when a solid veRTical baR is suppoRTinG an oveRhead weiGhT, each paRTicle in The baR pushes on The paRTicles iMMediaTely below iT.
When a liquid is in a closed conTaineR undeR pRessuRe, each paRTicle GeTs pushed aGainsT by all The suRRoundinG paRTicles.
The conTaineR walls and The pRessuRe-inducinG suRFace (such as a pisTon) push aGainsT TheM in (NewTonian) ReacTion.
