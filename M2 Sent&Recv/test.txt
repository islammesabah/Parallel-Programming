EArly develOpmentS

Very eArly cOmputerS, Such AS COlOSSuS, were prOgrAmmed wIthOut the help Of A StOred prOgrAm, by mOdIfyIng theIr cIrcuItry Or SettIng bAnKS Of phySIcAl cOntrOlS.

SlIghtly lAter, prOgrAmS cOuld be wrItten In mAchIne lAnguAge, where the prOgrAmmer wrIteS eAch InStructIOn In A numerIc fOrm the hArdwAre cAn execute dIrectly. FOr exAmple, the InStructIOn tO Add the vAlue In twO memOry lOcAtIOn mIght cOnSISt Of 3 numberS: An "OpcOde" thAt SelectS the "Add" OperAtIOn, And twO memOry lOcAtIOnS. The prOgrAmS, In decImAl Or bInAry fOrm, were reAd In frOm punched cArdS, pAper tApe, mAgnetIc tApe Or tOggled In On SwItcheS On the frOnt pAnel Of the cOmputer. MAchIne lAnguAgeS were lAter termed fIrSt-generAtIOn prOgrAmmIng lAnguAgeS (1GL).

The next Step wAS develOpment Of SO-cAlled SecOnd-generAtIOn prOgrAmmIng lAnguAgeS (2GL) Or ASSembly lAnguAgeS, whIch were StIll clOSely tIed tO the InStructIOn Set ArchItecture Of the SpecIfIc cOmputer. TheSe Served tO mAKe the prOgrAm much mOre humAn-reAdAble And relIeved the prOgrAmmer Of tedIOuS And errOr-prOne AddreSS cAlculAtIOnS.

The fIrSt hIgh-level prOgrAmmIng lAnguAgeS, Or thIrd-generAtIOn prOgrAmmIng lAnguAgeS (3GL), were wrItten In the 1950S. An eArly hIgh-level prOgrAmmIng lAnguAge tO be deSIgned fOr A cOmputer wAS PlAnKAlKül, develOped fOr the GermAn Z3 by KOnrAd ZuSe between 1943 And 1945. HOwever, It wAS nOt Implemented untIl 1998 And 2000.[26]

JOhn MAuchly'S ShOrt COde, prOpOSed In 1949, wAS One Of the fIrSt hIgh-level lAnguAgeS ever develOped fOr An electrOnIc cOmputer.[27] UnlIKe mAchIne cOde, ShOrt COde StAtementS repreSented mAthemAtIcAl expreSSIOnS In underStAndAble fOrm.

The SecOnd AutOcOde wAS develOped fOr the MArK 1 by R. A. BrOOKer In 1954 And wAS cAlled the "MArK 1 AutOcOde". BrOOKer AlSO develOped An AutOcOde fOr the FerrAntI Mercury In the 1950S In cOnjunctIOn wIth the UnIverSIty Of MAncheSter. The verSIOn fOr the EDSAC 2 wAS devISed by D. F.

PrOgrAmmIng lAnguAge SyntAx IS uSuAlly defIned uSIng A cOmbInAtIOn Of regulAr expreSSIOnS (fOr lexIcAl Structure) And BAcKuS–NAur fOrm (fOr grAmmAtIcAl Structure). BelOw IS A SImple grAmmAr, bASed On LISp:

number     ::= [+-]?['0'-'9']+
SymbOl     ::= ['A'-'Z''A'-'z'].*

ThIS grAmmAr SpecIfIeS the fOllOwIng:

The fOllOwIng Are exAmpleS Of well-fOrmed tOKen SequenceS In thIS grAmmAr: 12345, () And (A b c232 (1)).

NOt All SyntActIcAlly cOrrect prOgrAmS Are SemAntIcAlly cOrrect. MAny SyntActIcAlly cOrrect prOgrAmS Are nOnetheleSS Ill-fOrmed, per the lAnguAge'S ruleS; And mAy (dependIng On the lAnguAge SpecIfIcAtIOn And the SOundneSS Of the ImplementAtIOn) reSult In An errOr On trAnSlAtIOn Or executIOn.

PrOgrAmmIng lAnguAge SyntAx IS uSuAlly defIned uSIng A cOmbInAtIOn Of regulAr expreSSIOnS (fOr lexIcAl Structure) And BAcKuS–NAur fOrm (fOr grAmmAtIcAl Structure). BelOw IS A SImple grAmmAr, bASed On LISp:

number     ::= [+-]?['0'-'9']+
SymbOl     ::= ['A'-'Z''A'-'z'].*
lISt       ::= '(' expreSSIOn* ')'

ThIS grAmmAr SpecIfIeS the fOllOwIng:

    An expreSSIOn IS eIther An AtOm Or A lISt;
    An AtOm IS eIther A number Or A SymbOl;

Very eArly cOmputerS, Such AS COlOSSuS, were prOgrAmmed wIthOut the help Of A StOred prOgrAm, by mOdIfyIng theIr cIrcuItry Or SettIng bAnKS Of phySIcAl cOntrOlS.

SlIghtly lAter, prOgrAmS cOuld be wrItten In mAchIne lAnguAge, where the prOgrAmmer wrIteS eAch InStructIOn In A numerIc fOrm the hArdwAre cAn execute dIrectly. FOr exAmple, the InStructIOn tO Add the vAlue In twO memOry lOcAtIOn mIght cOnSISt Of 3 numberS: An "OpcOde" thAt SelectS the "Add" OperAtIOn, And twO memOry lOcAtIOnS. The prOgrAmS, In decImAl Or bInAry fOrm, were reAd In frOm punched cArdS, pAper tApe, mAgnetIc tApe Or tOggled In On SwItcheS On the frOnt pAnel Of the cOmputer. MAchIne lAnguAgeS were lAter termed fIrSt-generAtIOn prOgrAmmIng lAnguAgeS (1GL).

The next Step wAS develOpment Of SO-cAlled SecOnd-generAtIOn prOgrAmmIng lAnguAgeS (2GL) Or ASSembly lAnguAgeS, whIch were StIll clOSely tIed tO the InStructIOn Set ArchItecture Of the SpecIfIc cOmputer. TheSe Served tO mAKe the prOgrAm much mOre humAn-reAdAble And relIeved the prOgrAmmer Of tedIOuS And errOr-prOne AddreSS cAlculAtIOnS.

The fIrSt hIgh-level prOgrAmmIng lAnguAgeS, Or thIrd-generAtIOn prOgrAmmIng lAnguAgeS (3GL), were wrItten In the 1950S. An eArly hIgh-level prOgrAmmIng lAnguAge tO be deSIgned fOr A cOmputer wAS PlAnKAlKül, develOped fOr the GermAn Z3 by KOnrAd ZuSe between 1943 And 1945. HOwever, It wAS nOt Implemented untIl 1998 And 2000.[26]

JOhn MAuchly'S ShOrt COde, prOpOSed In 1949, wAS One Of the fIrSt hIgh-level lAnguAgeS ever develOped fOr An electrOnIc cOmputer.[27] UnlIKe mAchIne cOde, ShOrt COde StAtementS repreSented mAthemAtIcAl expreSSIOnS In underStAndAble fOrm. HOwever, the prOgrAm hAd tO be trAnSlAted IntO mAchIne cOde every tIme It rAn, mAKIng the prOceSS much SlOwer thAn runnIng the equIvAlent mAchIne cOde.

At the UnIverSIty Of MAncheSter, AlIcK GlennIe develOped AutOcOde In the eArly 1950S. AS A prOgrAmmIng lAnguAge, It uSed A cOmpIler tO AutOmAtIcAlly cOnvert the lAnguAge IntO mAchIne cOde. The fIrSt cOde And cOmpIler wAS develOped In 1952 fOr the MArK 1 cOmputer At the UnIverSIty Of MAncheSter And IS cOnSIdered tO be the fIrSt cOmpIled hIgh-level prOgrAmmIng lAnguAge.[28][29]

The SecOnd AutOcOde wAS develOped fOr the MArK 1 by R. A. BrOOKer In 1954 And wAS cAlled the "MArK 1 AutOcOde". BrOOKer AlSO develOped An AutOcOde fOr the FerrAntI Mercury In the 1950S In cOnjunctIOn wIth the UnIverSIty Of MAncheSter. The verSIOn fOr the EDSAC 2 wAS devISed by D. F.

AnOther eArly prOgrAmmIng lAnguAge wAS devISed by GrAce HOpper In the US, cAlled FLOW-MATIC. It wAS develOped fOr the UNIVAC I At RemIngtOn RAnd durIng the perIOd frOm 1955 untIl 1959. HOpper fOund thAt buSIneSS dAtA prOceSSIng cuStOmerS were uncOmfOrtAble wIth mAthemAtIcAl nOtAtIOn, And In eArly 1955, She And her teAm wrOte A SpecIfIcAtIOn fOr An EnglISh prOgrAmmIng lAnguAge And Implemented A prOtOtype.[34] The FLOW-MATIC cOmpIler becAme publIcly AvAIlAble In eArly 1958 And wAS SubStAntIAlly cOmplete In 1959.[35] FLOW-MATIC wAS A mAjOr Influence In the deSIgn Of COBOL, SInce Only It And ItS dIrect deScendAnt AIMACO were In ActuAl uSe At the tIme.[36]
RefInement

The IncreASed uSe Of hIgh-level lAnguAgeS IntrOduced A requIrement fOr lOw-level prOgrAmmIng lAnguAgeS Or SyStem prOgrAmmIng lAnguAgeS. TheSe lAnguAgeS, tO vAryIng degreeS, prOvIde fAcIlItIeS between ASSembly lAnguAgeS And hIgh-level lAnguAgeS.

The perIOd frOm the 1960S tO the lAte 1970S brOught the develOpment Of the mAjOr lAnguAge pArAdIgmS nOw In uSe:

    APL IntrOduced ArrAy prOgrAmmIng And Influenced functIOnAl prOgrAmmIng.[37]
    ALGOL refIned bOth Structured prOcedurAl prOgrAmmIng And the dIScIplIne Of lAnguAge SpecIfIcAtIOn; the "RevISed RepOrt On the AlgOrIthmIc LAnguAge ALGOL 60" becAme A mOdel fOr hOw lAter lAnguAge SpecIfIcAtIOnS were wrItten.
    LISp, Implemented In 1958, wAS the fIrSt dynAmIcAlly typed functIOnAl prOgrAmmIng lAnguAge.
    In the 1960S, SImulA wAS the fIrSt lAnguAge deSIgned tO SuppOrt Object-OrIented prOgrAmmIng; In the mId-1970S, SmAlltAlK fOllOwed wIth the fIrSt "purely" Object-OrIented lAnguAge.
    C wAS develOped between 1969 And 1973 AS A SyStem prOgrAmmIng lAnguAge fOr the UnIx OperAtIng SyStem And remAInS pOpulAr.[38]
    PrOlOg, deSIgned In 1972, wAS the fIrSt lOgIc prOgrAmmIng lAnguAge.
    In 1978, ML buIlt A pOlymOrphIc type SyStem On tOp Of LISp, pIOneerIng StAtIcAlly typed functIOnAl prOgrAmmIng lAnguAgeS.

EAch Of theSe lAnguAgeS SpAwned deScendAntS, And mOSt mOdern prOgrAmmIng lAnguAgeS cOunt At leASt One Of them In theIr AnceStry.

The 1960S And 1970S AlSO SAw cOnSIderAble debAte Over the merItS Of Structured prOgrAmmIng, And whether prOgrAmmIng lAnguAgeS ShOuld be deSIgned tO SuppOrt It.[39] EdSger DIjKStrA, In A fAmOuS 1968 letter publIShed In the COmmunIcAtIOnS Of the ACM, Argued thAt GOTO StAtementS ShOuld be elImInAted frOm All "hIgher level" prOgrAmmIng lAnguAgeS.[40]

The 1980S were yeArS Of relAtIve cOnSOlIdAtIOn. C++ cOmbIned Object-OrIented And SyStemS prOgrAmmIng. The UnIted StAteS gOvernment StAndArdIzed AdA, A SyStemS prOgrAmmIng lAnguAge derIved frOm PAScAl And Intended fOr uSe by defenSe cOntrActOrS.

MOdulA-2, AdA, And ML All develOped nOtAble mOdule SyStemS In the 1980S, whIch were Often wedded tO generIc prOgrAmmIng cOnStructS.[42]

The rApId grOwth Of the Internet In the mId-1990S creAted OppOrtunItIeS fOr new lAnguAgeS. Perl, OrIgInAlly A UnIx ScrIptIng tOOl fIrSt releASed In 1987, becAme cOmmOn In dynAmIc webSIteS.

TheSe develOpmentS were nOt fundAmentAlly nOvel, rAther they were refInementS Of mAny exIStIng lAnguAgeS And pArAdIgmS (AlthOugh theIr SyntAx wAS Often bASed On the C fAmIly Of prOgrAmmIng lAnguAgeS).

PrOgrAmmIng lAnguAge evOlutIOn cOntInueS, In bOth InduStry And reSeArch. Current dIrectIOnS Include SecurIty And relIAbIlIty verIfIcAtIOn, new KIndS Of mOdulArIty (mIxInS, delegAteS, ASpectS), And dAtAbASe IntegrAtIOn Such AS MIcrOSOft'S LINQ.

SyntAx hIghlIghtIng IS Often uSed tO AId prOgrAmmerS In recOgnIzIng elementS Of SOurce cOde. The lAnguAge AbOve IS PythOn.

A prOgrAmmIng lAnguAge'S SurfAce fOrm IS KnOwn AS ItS SyntAx. MOSt prOgrAmmIng lAnguAgeS Are purely textuAl; they uSe SequenceS Of text IncludIng wOrdS, numberS, And punctuAtIOn, much lIKe wrItten nAturAl lAnguAgeS. On the Other hAnd, there Are SOme prOgrAmmIng lAnguAgeS whIch Are mOre grAphIcAl In nAture, uSIng vISuAl relAtIOnShIpS between SymbOlS tO SpecIfy A prOgrAm.

The SyntAx Of A lAnguAge deScrIbeS the pOSSIble cOmbInAtIOnS Of SymbOlS thAt fOrm A SyntActIcAlly cOrrect prOgrAm. The meAnIng gIven tO A cOmbInAtIOn Of SymbOlS IS hAndled by SemAntIcS (eIther fOrmAl Or hArd-cOded In A reference ImplementAtIOn). SInce mOSt lAnguAgeS Are textuAl, thIS ArtIcle dIScuSSeS textuAl SyntAx.

PrOgrAmmIng lAnguAge SyntAx IS uSuAlly defIned uSIng A cOmbInAtIOn Of regulAr expreSSIOnS (fOr lexIcAl Structure) And BAcKuS–NAur fOrm (fOr grAmmAtIcAl Structure). BelOw IS A SImple grAmmAr, bASed On LISp:

expreSSIOn ::= AtOm | lISt
AtOm       ::= number | SymbOl
number     ::= [+-]?['0'-'9']+
SymbOl     ::= ['A'-'Z''A'-'z'].*
lISt       ::= '(' expreSSIOn* ')'

ThIS grAmmAr SpecIfIeS the fOllOwIng:

    An expreSSIOn IS eIther An AtOm Or A lISt;
    An AtOm IS eIther A number Or A SymbOl;
    A number IS An unbrOKen Sequence Of One Or mOre decImAl dIgItS, OptIOnAlly preceded by A pluS Or mInuS SIgn;
    A SymbOl IS A letter fOllOwed by zerO Or mOre Of Any chArActerS (excludIng whIteSpAce); And
    A lISt IS A mAtched pAIr Of pArentheSeS, wIth zerO Or mOre expreSSIOnS InSIde It.

The fOllOwIng Are exAmpleS Of well-fOrmed tOKen SequenceS In thIS grAmmAr: 12345, () And (A b c232 (1)).

NOt All SyntActIcAlly cOrrect prOgrAmS Are SemAntIcAlly cOrrect. MAny SyntActIcAlly cOrrect prOgrAmS Are nOnetheleSS Ill-fOrmed, per the lAnguAge'S ruleS; And mAy (dependIng On the lAnguAge SpecIfIcAtIOn And the SOundneSS Of the ImplementAtIOn) reSult In An errOr On trAnSlAtIOn Or executIOn. In SOme cASeS, Such prOgrAmS mAy exhIbIt undefIned behAvIOr. Even when A prOgrAm IS well-defIned wIthIn A lAnguAge, It mAy StIll hAve A meAnIng thAt IS nOt Intended by the perSOn whO wrOte It.

USIng nAturAl lAnguAge AS An exAmple, It mAy nOt be pOSSIble tO ASSIgn A meAnIng tO A grAmmAtIcAlly cOrrect Sentence Or the Sentence mAy be fAlSe:

    "COlOrleSS green IdeAS Sleep furIOuSly." IS grAmmAtIcAlly well-fOrmed but hAS nO generAlly Accepted meAnIng.
    "JOhn IS A mArrIed bAchelOr." IS grAmmAtIcAlly well-fOrmed but expreSSeS A meAnIng thAt cAnnOt be true.

The fOllOwIng C lAnguAge frAgment IS SyntActIcAlly cOrrect, but perfOrmS OperAtIOnS thAt Are nOt SemAntIcAlly defIned (the OperAtIOn *p >> 4 hAS nO meAnIng fOr A vAlue hAvIng A cOmplex type And p->Im IS nOt defIned becAuSe the vAlue Of p IS the null pOInter):

cOmplex *p = NULL;
cOmplex AbS_p = Sqrt(*p >> 4 + p->Im);

If the type declArAtIOn On the fIrSt lIne were OmItted, the prOgrAm wOuld trIgger An errOr On undefIned vArIAble "p" durIng cOmpIlAtIOn. HOwever, the prOgrAm wOuld StIll be SyntActIcAlly cOrrect SInce type declArAtIOnS prOvIde Only SemAntIc InfOrmAtIOn.

StrOng typIng preventS theSe prOgrAm fAultS. An Attempt tO perfOrm An OperAtIOn On the wrOng type Of vAlue rAISeS An errOr.[47] StrOngly typed lAnguAgeS Are Often termed type-SAfe Or SAfe.

An AlternAtIve defInItIOn fOr "weAKly typed" referS tO lAnguAgeS, Such AS Perl And JAvAScrIpt, whIch permIt A lArge number Of ImplIcIt type cOnverSIOnS. In JAvAScrIpt, fOr exAmple, the expreSSIOn 2 * x ImplIcItly cOnvertS x tO A number, And thIS cOnverSIOn SucceedS even If x IS null, undefIned, An ArrAy, Or A StrIng Of letterS. Such ImplIcIt cOnverSIOnS Are Often uSeful, but they cAn mASK prOgrAmmIng errOrS. StrOng And StAtIc Are nOw generAlly cOnSIdered OrthOgOnAl cOnceptS, but uSAge In the lIterAture dIfferS.

MAchIne lAnguAgeS were lAter termed fIrSt-generAtIOn prOgrAmmIng lAnguAgeS (1GL).

The next Step wAS develOpment Of SO-cAlled SecOnd-generAtIOn prOgrAmmIng lAnguAgeS (2GL) Or ASSembly lAnguAgeS, whIch were StIll clOSely tIed tO the InStructIOn Set ArchItecture Of the SpecIfIc cOmputer. TheSe Served tO mAKe the prOgrAm much mOre humAn-reAdAble And relIeved the prOgrAmmer Of tedIOuS And errOr-prOne AddreSS cAlculAtIOnS.

The fIrSt hIgh-level prOgrAmmIng lAnguAgeS, Or thIrd-generAtIOn prOgrAmmIng lAnguAgeS (3GL), were wrItten In the 1950S.

StrOng typIng preventS theSe prOgrAm fAultS. An Attempt tO perfOrm An OperAtIOn On the wrOng type Of vAlue rAISeS An errOr.[47] StrOngly typed lAnguAgeS Are Often termed type-SAfe Or SAfe.
