EArly develOpmentS

Very eArly cOmputerS, Such AS COlOSSuS, were prOgrAmmed wIthOut the help Of A StOred prOgrAm, by mOdIfyIng theIr cIrcuItry Or SettIng bAnKS Of phySIcAl cOntrOlS.

SlIghtly lAter, prOgrAmS cOuld be wrItten In mAchIne lAnguAge, where the prOgrAmmer wrIteS eAch InStructIOn In A numerIc fOrm the hArdwAre cAn execute dIrectly. FOr exAmple, the InStructIOn tO Add the vAlue In twO memOry lOcAtIOn mIght cOnSISt Of 3 numberS: An "OpcOde" thAt SelectS the "Add" OperAtIOn, And twO memOry lOcAtIOnS. The prOgrAmS, In decImAl Or bInAry fOrm, were reAd In frOm punched cArdS, pAper tApe, mAgnetIc tApe Or tOggled In On SwItcheS On the frOnt pAnel Of the cOmputer. MAchIne lAnguAgeS were lAter termed fIrSt-generAtIOn prOgrAmmIng lAnguAgeS (1GL).

The next Step wAS develOpment Of SO-cAlled SecOnd-generAtIOn prOgrAmmIng lAnguAgeS (2GL) Or ASSembly lAnguAgeS, whIch were StIll clOSely tIed tO the InStructIOn Set ArchItecture Of the SpecIfIc cOmputer. TheSe Served tO mAKe the prOgrAm much mOre humAn-reAdAble And relIeved the prOgrAmmer Of tedIOuS And errOr-prOne AddreSS cAlculAtIOnS.

The fIrSt hIgh-level prOgrAmmIng lAnguAgeS, Or thIrd-generAtIOn prOgrAmmIng lAnguAgeS (3GL), were wrItten In the 1950S. An eArly hIgh-level prOgrAmmIng lAnguAge tO be deSIgned fOr A cOmputer wAS PlAnKAlKÃ¼l, develOped fOr the GermAn Z3 by KOnrAd ZuSe between 1943 And 1945. HOwever, It wAS nOt Implemented untIl 1998 And 2000.[26]

JOhn MAuchly'S ShOrt COde, prOpOSed In 1949, wAS One Of the fIrSt hIgh-level lAnguAgeS ever develOped fOr An electrOnIc cOmputer.[27] UnlIKe mAchIne cOde, ShOrt COde StAtementS repreSented mAthemAtIcAl expreSSIOnS In underStAndAble fOrm.

The SecOnd AutOcOde wAS develOped fOr the MArK 1 by R. A. BrOOKer In 1954 And wAS cAlled the "MArK 1 AutOcOde". BrOOKer AlSO develOped An AutOcOde fOr the FerrAntI Mercury In the 1950S In cOnjunctIOn wIth the UnIverSIty Of MAncheSter. The verSIOn fOr the EDSAC 2 wAS devISed by D. F.

HOpper fOund thAt buSIneSS dAtA prOceSSIng cuStOmerS were uncOmfOrtAble wIth mAthemAtIcAl nOtAtIOn, And In eArly 1955, She And her teAm wrOte A SpecIfIcAtIOn fOr An EnglISh prOgrAmmIng lAnguAge And Implemented A prOtOtype.[34] The FLOW-MATIC cOmpIler becAme publIcly AvAIlAble In eArly 1958 And wAS SubStAntIAlly cOmplete In 1959.[35] FLOW-MATIC wAS A mAjOr Influence In the deSIgn Of COBOL, SInce Only It And ItS dIrect deScendAnt AIMACO were In ActuAl uSe At the tIme.[36]

ThIS grAmmAr SpecIfIeS the fOllOwIng:

SymbOl     ::= ['A'-'Z''A'-'z'].*

ThIS grAmmAr SpecIfIeS the fOllOwIng:

The fOllOwIng Are exAmpleS Of well-fOrmed tOKen SequenceS In thIS grAmmAr: 12345, () And (A b c232 (1)).

NOt All SyntActIcAlly cOrrect prOgrAmS Are SemAntIcAlly cOrrect. MAny SyntActIcAlly cOrrect prOgrAmS Are nOnetheleSS Ill-fOrmed, per the lAnguAge'S ruleS; And mAy (dependIng On the lAnguAge SpecIfIcAtIOn And the SOundneSS Of the ImplementAtIOn) reSult In An errOr On trAnSlAtIOn Or executIOn.

cOmplex *p = NULL;

If the type declArAtIOn On the fIrSt lIne were OmItted, the prOgrAm wOuld trIgger An errOr On undefIned vArIAble "p" durIng cOmpIlAtIOn. HOwever, the prOgrAm wOuld StIll be SyntActIcAlly cOrrect SInce type declArAtIOnS prOvIde Only SemAntIc InfOrmAtIOn.

number     ::= [+-]?['0'-'9']+
SymbOl     ::= ['A'-'Z''A'-'z'].*

ThIS grAmmAr SpecIfIeS the fOllOwIng:

    An expreSSIOn IS eIther An AtOm Or A lISt;

The fOllOwIng Are exAmpleS Of well-fOrmed tOKen SequenceS In thIS grAmmAr: 12345, () And (A b c232 (1)).

NOt All SyntActIcAlly cOrrect prOgrAmS Are SemAntIcAlly cOrrect. MAny SyntActIcAlly cOrrect prOgrAmS Are nOnetheleSS Ill-fOrmed, per the lAnguAge'S ruleS; And mAy (dependIng On the lAnguAge SpecIfIcAtIOn And the SOundneSS Of the ImplementAtIOn) reSult In An errOr On trAnSlAtIOn Or executIOn.

MAchIne lAnguAgeS were lAter termed fIrSt-generAtIOn prOgrAmmIng lAnguAgeS (1GL).

The next Step wAS develOpment Of SO-cAlled SecOnd-generAtIOn prOgrAmmIng lAnguAgeS (2GL) Or ASSembly lAnguAgeS, whIch were StIll clOSely tIed tO the InStructIOn Set ArchItecture Of the SpecIfIc cOmputer.

Very eArly cOmputerS, Such AS COlOSSuS, were prOgrAmmed wIthOut the help Of A StOred prOgrAm, by mOdIfyIng theIr cIrcuItry Or SettIng bAnKS Of phySIcAl cOntrOlS.

SlIghtly lAter, prOgrAmS cOuld be wrItten In mAchIne lAnguAge, where the prOgrAmmer wrIteS eAch InStructIOn In A numerIc fOrm the hArdwAre cAn execute dIrectly.

MAchIne lAnguAgeS were lAter termed fIrSt-generAtIOn prOgrAmmIng lAnguAgeS (1GL).

The next Step wAS develOpment Of SO-cAlled SecOnd-generAtIOn prOgrAmmIng lAnguAgeS (2GL) Or ASSembly lAnguAgeS, whIch were StIll clOSely tIed tO the InStructIOn Set ArchItecture Of the SpecIfIc cOmputer. TheSe Served tO mAKe the prOgrAm much mOre humAn-reAdAble And relIeved the prOgrAmmer Of tedIOuS And errOr-prOne AddreSS cAlculAtIOnS.

The fIrSt hIgh-level prOgrAmmIng lAnguAgeS, Or thIrd-generAtIOn prOgrAmmIng lAnguAgeS (3GL), were wrItten In the 1950S.

The SecOnd AutOcOde wAS develOped fOr the MArK 1 by R. A. BrOOKer In 1954 And wAS cAlled the "MArK 1 AutOcOde". BrOOKer AlSO develOped An AutOcOde fOr the FerrAntI Mercury In the 1950S In cOnjunctIOn wIth the UnIverSIty Of MAncheSter. The verSIOn fOr the EDSAC 2 wAS devISed by D. F.

StrOng typIng preventS theSe prOgrAm fAultS. An Attempt tO perfOrm An OperAtIOn On the wrOng type Of vAlue rAISeS An errOr.[47] StrOngly typed lAnguAgeS Are Often termed type-SAfe Or SAfe.
