IN CONTINUUM MEChANICS, STRESS IS A PhySICAL qUANTITy ThAT ExPRESSES ThE INTERNAL fORCES ThAT NEIGhbOURING PARTICLES Of A CONTINUOUS 


MATERIAL ExERT ON EACh OThER, whILE STRAIN IS ThE MEASURE Of ThE dEfORMATION Of ThE MATERIAL whICh IS NOT A PhySICAL qUANTITy . FOR 


ExAMPLE, whEN A SOLId vERTICAL bAR IS SUPPORTING AN OvERhEAd wEIGhT, EACh PARTICLE IN ThE bAR PUShES ON ThE PARTICLES IMMEdIATELy bELOw IT.


WhEN A LIqUId IS IN A CLOSEd CONTAINER UNdER PRESSURE, EACh PARTICLE GETS PUShEd AGAINST by ALL ThE SURROUNdING PARTICLES.
