IN the fIrSt cASe, the prOgrAmmer muSt explIcItly wrIte typeS At certAIN textuAl pOSItIONS (fOr exAmple, At vArIAble declArAtIONS).

DyNAmIc typINg, AlSO cAlled lAteNt typINg, determINeS the type-SAfety Of OperAtIONS At ruN tIme; IN Other wOrdS, typeS Are ASSOcIAted wIth ruN-tIme vAlueS rAther thAN textuAl expreSSIONS.[47] AS wIth type-INferred lANguAgeS, dyNAmIcAlly typed lANguAgeS dO NOt requIre the prOgrAmmer tO wrIte explIcIt type ANNOtAtIONS ON expreSSIONS.

AN AlterNAtIve defINItION fOr "weAKly typed" referS tO lANguAgeS, Such AS Perl ANd JAvAScrIpt, whIch permIt A lArge Number Of ImplIcIt type cONverSIONS.
