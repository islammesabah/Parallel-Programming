IN StAtIc typING, All expreSSIONS hAve theIr typeS determINed prIOr tO wheN the prOGrAm IS executed, typIcAlly At cOmpIle-tIme. FOr exAmple, 1 ANd (2+2) Are INteGer expreSSIONS; they cANNOt be pASSed tO A fuNctION thAt expectS A StrING, Or StOred IN A vArIAble thAt IS defINed tO hOld dAteS.[47]

IN the fIrSt cASe, the prOGrAmmer muSt explIcItly wrIte typeS At certAIN textuAl pOSItIONS (fOr exAmple, At vArIAble declArAtIONS).

WeAK typING AllOwS A vAlue Of ONe type tO be treAted AS ANOther, fOr exAmple treAtING A StrING AS A Number.[47] ThIS cAN OccASIONAlly be uSeful, but It cAN AlSO AllOw SOme KINdS Of prOGrAm fAultS tO GO uNdetected At cOmpIle tIme ANd eveN At ruN tIme.

StrONG typING preveNtS theSe prOGrAm fAultS. AN Attempt tO perfOrm AN OperAtION ON the wrONG type Of vAlue rAISeS AN errOr.[47] StrONGly typed lANGuAGeS Are OfteN termed type-SAfe Or SAfe.

AN AlterNAtIve defINItION fOr "weAKly typed" referS tO lANGuAGeS, Such AS Perl ANd JAvAScrIpt, whIch permIt A lArGe Number Of ImplIcIt type cONverSIONS. IN JAvAScrIpt, fOr exAmple, the expreSSION 2 * x ImplIcItly cONvertS x tO A Number, ANd thIS cONverSION SucceedS eveN If x IS Null, uNdefINed, AN ArrAy, Or A StrING Of letterS. Such ImplIcIt cONverSIONS Are OfteN uSeful, but they cAN mASK prOGrAmmING errOrS. StrONG ANd StAtIc Are NOw GeNerAlly cONSIdered OrthOGONAl cONceptS, but uSAGe IN the lIterAture dIfferS.
