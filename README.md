# Parallel-Programming

The project is in the area of searching. We take an input from the user which is a character and search for it in a text (which is taken from a file) and make capital in that text then write the output back to the file again.

We do this task using several parallel programming techniques (Sent&Recv/Bcast&Reduce/Scatter&Gather) which is available in the MPI library, the small text file will not show the useful usage of the parallel programming so we need large text file.

There are some applications for this area. It can be used in searching for specific element in an array (can be database of users in web app) and fetch its data, so we program the server with these parallel programming techniques.
